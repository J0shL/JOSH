        <h2><li>Just what is Josh?</li></h2>
          Hellow world, I am Josh, although my official name is Liw Yui Heng.<br> I came from West Spring Secondary and barely made the<br> cutoff but I'll still do better than you...probably.
   <br><br><br>
        <h2><li>Aspirations</h2></li>
      I'm going to get rich and then live deep in the mountains as a secret millionaire, and<br> then I'll become an urban legend: The Mysterious Mansion in the Mountains. Learning<br> coding is just one of the many steps I need to take in order to achieve that wealth.
      <br><br><br>
      <h2><li>Hobbies/interests</h2></li>
    I've got an interest in half of all things so I never stick to any one for too long. My hobbies<br> only last as long as I am still interested so I hop between them more than I like to admit. <br>As a result I ended up with a Jack of all, Master of none kinda deal. My current hobbies are<br> gambling and cooking.
